# IMPORTANT

These files are to assist with local development work e.g. styling. They are not used for 'real' B2C.

The main content of the B2C screens is injected by Microsoft. We don't own or maintain or edit the HTML content of these files. The best we can do is edit and style them via JavaScript and CSS.

These files are to offer a preview of B2C html when styled with the main.css from govuk-frontend.
