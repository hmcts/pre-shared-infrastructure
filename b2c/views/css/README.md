# IMPORTANT

The main content of the B2C screens is injected by Microsoft. We don't own or maintain or edit the HTML content of these files.

We want to style B2C in accordance with govuk-frontend styling as used on other government services, but as we can't add govuk-frontend classes and tags to the injected HTML, we need to use the tags that are already present in the HTML.

When upgrading govuk-frontend main.css, you need to add in #api styles in the correct places. Don't simply download and replace the old with the new CSS.
